Ioan Curbat's personal Web Page

This page contains different projects I have worked on throughout college while also testing the basic HTML and CSS skills I have acquired so far by self-study.

The project was done with help from The Odin Project's courses and sources. (https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Enjoy!
